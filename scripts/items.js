"announcement": "Reminder:  I cannot accept requests to rush your order unless you have talked to me about it before you place the order.  I seem to be getting a lot of orders with notes saying, &quot;And by the way, I need this in three days&quot;.  I do not keep an &#39;on hand&#39; inventory.  Everything is made just for you.  And as much as it pains me to say, I do not run the US Postal Service, so shipping still takes time.  Often more than either of us would like.  Etsy sends an estimated ship date when you place your order and that date will be honored.  If you need your items before that, please CONTACT ME FIRST!  I&#39;m happy to work with you, but when I get busy, I simply can&#39;t put everything on the top of the list.  Thanks for understanding!\r\n\r\n******************\r\n\r\nNeed those Chill Pills yesterday?  In the Chicago area?  Wizard at Work is now being sold through The Blue Buddha Boutique in Edgewater!  They&#39;re carrying a select line of my Sci Fi and Comic soaps and lotion bars as well as my chill pill soaps and bath bombs.  They&#39;re essentially under the Grandville Red Line stop, so they&#39;re super easy to find!  http://www.bluebuddhaboutique.com/\r\n\r\n******************\r\n\r\n7.26.14 - Want 15% off your order?  According to my data, I&#39;m getting a huge spike in customers who type in my store address or product URL, which means they&#39;re finding me somewhere other than the internet.  If you got to my shop or one of my products some OTHER way than searching in Etsy or clicking on a link within Etsy, drop me a note (either use the convo feature here on Etsy, or email wizardatwork12@gmial.com) and I&#39;ll send you back a coupon code for 15% off your purchase!  I&#39;d love to know how you&#39;re finding me!  Thanks!\r\n\r\n******************\r\n\r\n7.09.14 - In my ongoing effort to make my products better and better I&#39;ve been reading up on bath bomb recipes.  While I still endeavor to keep my ingredient list short and simple, my research and test batches have shown that adding a few drops of Sweet Almond Oil to my bath bombs really helps them to hold their shapes better - especially those made with intricate details.  Sweet Almond Oil is also fabulous for your skin.\r\n\r\nThis ingredient can be left out if you&#39;d like to keep things very, very simple.  Just leave me a note in your order and I&#39;d be happy to make yours with the basic ingredients.  All molds are sterilized in a dishwasher between uses.\r\n******************\r\n\r\n3.16.14  Fragrance Line additions!  I&#39;m trying some fun new fragrances.  Most of them haven&#39;t been added to most of the listings yet (that&#39;s SO time consuming!), but feel free to select &quot;custom&quot; and then leave one of these fun new scents in your notes with your order.  Why not try:  Candy Crush, Chocolate Covered Strawberries, Hazelnut Latte or Popcorn!  Also, Mangosteen is back in stock!  If you&#39;ve never tried it, it&#39;s a wonderful, sweet fruit scent.  Great for spring! (If it ever actually gets here...)\r\n\r\n******************\r\n\r\n2.01.14 - Shipping update!  Etsy has finally made it easy for me to update shipping costs and make them more country-specific!  This means I&#39;m estimating less and probably means that international customers will pay less for shipping!  I&#39;m in the process of adding country-specific shipping rates for the UK, Australia, France and Canada.  They&#39;re also giving me an option of one rate for the whole of the European Union, so I&#39;m monkeying with that to see how/if it works for everyone. Hopefully this will make shopping easier for my international customers.\r\n\r\n******************\r\n\r\n1.07.14 - I&#39;m letting my inner geek fly!  Keep an eye on my shop for soaps and lotion bars for the fans of Doctor Who, Star Trek, Star Wars, classic video games (I mean CLASSIC... back in the 80&#39;s Atari Classic!) and more!\r\n\r\n******************\r\n\r\n5.19.13 - And another one bites the dust. :)  Like Mangosteen, I got Violet fragrance oil as a sample from one of my suppliers.  It took me over a year to go through the one ounce they sent me, so I&#39;m not going to order any more at this point.  If you really like it, I can get ahold of it, but I&#39;ll need a little lead time for it to be delivered.\r\n\r\nIn it&#39;s place I&#39;m going to start listing oatmeal, milk and honey (my latest sample) as I go through and update listings.  Feel free to request it in the notes to your order if I haven&#39;t gotten to your product yet with the update. :)\r\n\r\n******************\r\n\r\n3.20.13 - I&#39;m in print!  My shop was mentioned in the April 2013 issue of Parenting magazine.  I&#39;m on page 81, in the bit called &quot;The New Eco Hero&quot;.  I have to say, if you know anything about toys for small children, you know it&#39;s pretty amazing to share a sentence with Melissa and Doug toys!  \r\n\r\n******************\r\n\r\nThe current list of scents I can use in any of your custom bath items or candles is:\r\n\r\nUnscented \r\n\r\nAlmond biscotti\r\nApricot freesia\r\n\r\nBaby Powder\r\nBacon\r\nBanana Nut Bread\r\nBlack cherry\r\nBlue skies\r\nBlueberry\r\nBonfire\r\nBubble gum\r\nButtered Popcorn\r\n\r\nCandy Corn\r\nChipolte caramel\r\nChoc chip cookies\r\nClementine cupcake\r\nCoconut\r\nCoffee\r\nCola\r\nCool Water (type)\r\nCotton Candy\r\nCucumber melon\r\n\r\nDill Pickle,\r\nDuck farts\r\n\r\nEucalyptus\r\n\r\nFudge brownie\r\n\r\nGrape\r\nGrapefruit\r\nGrass Stain\r\nGreen apple\r\nGreen Tea\r\nGummi Bear\r\n\r\nHazelnut\r\nHoney almond\r\nHoneydew melon\r\nHoneysuckle\r\nHot chocolate\r\n\r\nKiwi\r\n\r\nLavender\r\nLemon cake\r\nLemonaide\r\nLime\r\n\r\nMango\r\nMaple pancakes\r\nMonkey love\r\nMountain Dew\r\nMulberry\r\n\r\nOatmeal, milk and honey\r\nOrange\r\n\r\nPapaya coconut\r\nPeach\r\nPeppermint\r\nPineapple\r\nPizza\r\nPomegranate\r\nPumpkin Spice\r\n\r\nRaspberry\r\nRed apple\r\nRoot Beer\r\nRose\r\nRum\r\n\r\nSaffron and honey\r\nSandalwood\r\nSpearmint\r\nSpiced apple cider\r\nStrawberry\r\nSugar cookies\r\nSugar plums\r\nSweet Pea (type)\r\n\r\nToasted Marshmallow\r\nToffee\r\n\r\nVanilla\r\nVanilla-Raspberry\r\n\r\nWatermelon\r\nWhite Ginger & Amber\r\nWhite Zinfendel\r\n\r\n\r\nI figure the pizza, pickle and bacon would be great for any boys or men who don&#39;t want to &#39;smell like a girl&#39; when they use a great, hand-crafted bath product.\r\n\r\nA few other fragrances that are a little more traditional, but also great for the males in your life:\r\nVanilla\r\nSandalwood\r\nBlue Sky\r\nBonfire\r\nPeppermint\r\n\r\n****************\r\n\r\nSo it&#39;s come to this... I am now receiving upwards of 4 messages a week from people who want me to send them a product for free so that they can &#39;review&#39; it on their website/youtube channel/facebook page, etc...\r\n\r\nI am not interested in these promotions.  If you send me a request for free items for a site like this, I will be forwarding it to Etsy&#39;s abuse team as spam.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m sure some of the requests are legitimate and maybe these reviews work for other people, but the sheer numbers of them that I have been receiving recently just makes it look like a lot of people are trying to get something for nothing.  And I don&#39;t want to get into the business of deciding who&#39;s a legitimate &#39;product reviewer&#39; and who&#39;s trying to scam Etsy artists.  So I&#39;m going to make an executive decision to just not be involved in any of them.  Thank you.\r\n\r\n****************\r\n\r\nSo many of you have been incredibly gracious in wishing my sick little girl ferret, Gaia, well when you order.  Unfortunately at the beginning of February Gaia finally succumbed to the effects of her two cancers.  I miss her like crazy.  On top of that, in early January one of my boys, K√°ri, was diagnosed with one of the two cancers Gaia had.  Adrenal cancer.  So he&#39;s on treatment for that now.  So if you were ordering stuff from me to support my rescue ferrets, well, we can still use your help.  K√°ri&#39;s treatments cost around $100 a month and in the next year or so he&#39;ll need an $800 surgery.  So we&#39;d appreciate your continued support.\r\n\r\nETA: February 2013:  Almost exactly a year to the day that I lost Gaia to a complication of her insulinoma cancer, my little boy Logi was diagnosed with the same disease.  He&#39;s doing well on a special diet and medication, but we&#39;re now facing that same battle again.\r\n\r\nOn the &#39;silver lining&#39; side... I&#39;m not going to run out of the baby food jars I use for the candles and scrubs any time soon now that I&#39;m back to making him &#39;duck soup&#39;.\r\n\r\n*^*^*^*^*\r\n\r\n\r\n12.03.14 - Please order ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER 7th for Christmas delivery.  I want to thank all of my amazing customers for making this my most mind-blowing winter season ever here on Etsy!  Because you are all so awesome, I&#39;m finding myself with more orders than ever before.  Because I really don&#39;t want to disappoint anyone by not getting their order to them on time, I am changing my ordering deadline to DECEMBER 7.  If you want your order in time for Christmas, I must have it on or before December 7th.\r\n\r\nI always endeavor to get orders out as fast as I possibly can, but orders placed on or after December 8 may or may not reach you before that magical morning.  So please place your order soon so that I can create that awesome custom product you want and get it in the mail sooner rather than later!\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I need to reiterate that if you do not contact me to see what my current turn around time, I cannot promise to honor rush requests.  I always try, but simply tacking, &quot;I need this by this Thursday&quot; onto your order may or may not work out depending on the complexity of your order, the distance between us and how many other rush orders I have.  So, PLEASE contact me first if you need your order before the date Etsy lists as the &quot;to be shipped by&quot; date on your order.  Thank you.\r\n\r\nFollow me on Facebook!

"policy_shipping": "Thanks for looking into my shop!\r\n\r\nI ship through the Etsy connection to the US Postal Service for all orders, including international purchases.  I ship the cheapest way possible, which for many of my items is USPS First Class (ground).  If you need your order sent Priority or faster, please contact me so that I can set up a special listing for you with the additional shipping cost.  Thanks!\r\n\r\nIf you do not contact me about rush orders, I will get your order out by the time stated on your Etsy receipt, but cannot guarantee that it will get out any sooner.  I will not accept requests for returns or refunds because you were &quot;hoping&quot; to get it sooner.\r\n\r\nBATH BOMBS (FIZZIES):  Bath bombs require at least two days to cure.  If you&#39;re ordering *only* odds and ends, I can ship them the next day because I have them on hand.  Anything else has to be molded on the day it&#39;s ordered, they need to cure for a full day, which means they&#39;ll get unmolded and packaged the third day and mailed on the fourth.  Or put more simply, if you order them on Monday, they&#39;ll get mailed on Thursday.\r\n\r\nMULTI COLORED SOAPS: The rainbow cube or sticks, the stained glass soaps, the set of fish soaps (which have to be made one at a time) etc... require that each small layer be poured and cooled before the next one can be poured.  This requires more time.  Please allow at least three days for these to be ready to be shipped.\r\n\r\nOther bath and body products (one pour soaps - including tie-dye styles, lotion bars, sugar scrubs, hand sanitizers...) can be produced and packaged either the day they&#39;re ordered or the next day, depending on when the order comes in.\r\n\r\nPlease ask about the lead time needed for large orders.  I love doing bulk orders (I&#39;ve done 600 bath bombs for someone, 85 dinosaur soaps for someone, 80 sets of soaps for wedding favors), but please ask about how much time a given large set needs.  Depending on what you need, I may have to order fragrance oil or base products to ensure I have enough to complete your purchase before I can even begin production.\r\n\r\nOther items, like cards, tags, photos and backpacks are on hand and should be able to ship immediately.\r\n\r\n***** But the best thing you can do is communicate with me either before or right after you order if you need your shipment before a particular date.  Thank you so much! *****\r\n\r\nWhen I&#39;m away from my workshop there will be a message in my Shop Announcements, explaining the length of time I&#39;ll be gone.  When I get back, I will work through orders placed while I was away in the order I received them and they will all go out as soon as possible.  If you place an order and then notice that it will take a significant amount of time to get it to you, feel free to request a cancelation of the the order.  If my travels take me away from the internet (which they occasionally do), I&#39;ll respond as soon as I get back.\r\n\r\nOnce I start producing a custom order of any kind, you cannot cancel the order.  If there is a problem with a custom order requiring you to cancel it, please get ahold of me immediately after placing the order.\r\n\r\n***WRONG ADDRESS***  If you notice after you place your order that Etsy has the wrong address on file for you, the only way I can correct it is for me to cancel your existing order, have you fix your address and re-order.  I know that&#39;s not at all convenient for anyone, but it is the only reliable way for me to make sure your order goes where you want it.",
"policy_refunds": "All of my soaps and bath products are custom made.  This requires time and can lead to slight variations between the photo on my site and your product or between any two products.\r\n\r\nRequests for refunds will be honored under the following circumstances:\r\n    - We discussed an arrival date and the package did not arrive due to errors on my end.\r\n    - I ship the wrong product.\r\n    - The order has not yet been made or shipped and you need to cancel the order.\r\n",

So I&#39;m going to make an executive decision to just not be involved in any of them.  Thank you.\r\n\r\n+++++++++\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re using a coupon code that specifies that a specific item or an specific category of item (any Halloween item or any photo print), or if the coupon code specifies a certain number of items must be bought and... you don&#39;t, I reserve the right to cancel your order.  \r\n\r\nI will make an effort to contact you so we can sort out any miscommunication (maybe you thought something was in a category and I didn&#39;t think of it that way).  I love using the coupon codes, but I&#39;d hate to see them be abused.  Thanks!\r\n\r\n",

"description": "Starbucks may have their mermaid--but certainly not as pretty as this one--according to some--;-) She often goes to the Mermaid Cafe where a lot of the sea&#39;s denizens hang out after a &#39;hard day&#39;s work&#39;--harvesting treasures from lost or sunken ships.  Her favorite drink? Why--a large frothy cup of cappuccino, of course--made from the berries of the sea coffee trees--served in a large shell cup with a red coral handle resting on a shell plate. A very whimsical scene with all the shades of  oranges, reds, browns and rusts accented by the curling blue/purple and magenta coral branches. As always, the image doesn&#39;t do justice to the actual print.\r\n\r\nSpecs: limited edition giclee print from an original fantasy art painting by Jade Bengco; approx. 11 X 15 inches on acid-free archival art paper; Edition of only 50 prints; signed/numbered/dated/hand embellished with metallic inks by the artist. Pls. note that the artist retains sole rights (publishing and reproduction) to the images.\r\n\r\nShipping will be priority mail with delivery confirmation. Pls. read shipping policy for more info.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions regarding the artwork, combined shipping, etc., pls. convo me. \r\nMany thanks!",

It really makes my day when I know that my artwork brings smiles to the people who purchase or are even just looking at them. \r\nMy original art is primarily done on thick watercolor paper with inks, waterclor and some acrylic. The canvas pieces I do are few and far between--so, they are pretty rare in my shop inventory. Limited edition prints are either professional high quality laser prints or giclees--editions limited to 100 at the most--on thick acid-free matte finish paper. \r\nSpecialized pieces such as halloween-themed items will be offered towards the Fall season. Mostly done on assorted shaped found wooden objects, these are going to be one-of-a-kind.\r\nBottom line is--I paint and create things that make me happy. I hope my pieces will do the same for you.",

Difference between shipping fee to actual charges will be refunded beyond a $1.00. \r\nShipping overseas: seller will not be held responsible for loss or damages once the items are shipped.\r\nDiscounted/Combined shipping available for multiple purchases that can be shipped together--i.e. original art on paper, wood boards, canvas and prints.

We inspect each piece before it is shipped, but please remember small imperfections are common in vintage clothing such as a broken thread here and there, light hanger stretch, a slight fabric flaw, or minor fading in colored fabrics.  \n\nAlso keep in mind that vintage sizing is quite different from modern day sizing.  We have found the best way to figure out if a garment will fit the way you like it to is to take a measuring tape and compare to something similar already in your closet.  If you would like additional measurements that are not already listed don‚Äôt ever hesitate to ask! \n\nPlease keep in mind that computer monitors display colors and contrasts differently.  Colors are close representations, and are not 100% exact.  \n\nIf you are unfamiliar with vintage clothing and need some guidance feel free to ask us any questions - we‚Äôd love to help. We are vintage fanatics over here!",

"title": "READY TO SHIP Morning Brew Slate Coasters (Set of 4) Birthday, Just Because, Housewarming, Christmas",
"description": "READY TO SHIP copper set. These Morning Brew coasters will make you smile as you drink something warm this winter. Pull these out for morning coffee when the family is over for the holidays and they will be a great conversation piece! These modern, homey coasters are a MUST for any house. These coasters make a thoughtful Christmas, birthday, housewarming, wedding or any type of celebration gift! \r\n\r\nB A S I C S : There are four coasters per set. The coasters are made out of slate and roughly measure 4&quot; x 4&quot; and 1/4&quot; thick. There are four protective feet on the bottom so there is no need to worry about scratching any surfaces. Each coaster is leveled so it does not rock or teeter.\r\nPlease spot clean only.\r\n\r\nS L A T E : I purchase my slate from a company here in the USA. The slate is generally a dark gray, but each coaster varies to some degree so please take this into account. The edges are rough and chipped, while the top and bottom can be smooth, rough, shiny, or two-toned. It is discolored and imperfect by nature. I do my best to match the slate pieces together for sets. Slate coasters are extremely durable, functional and easy to clean. Slate is able to withstand both hot and cold beverages while retaining most of your beverages condensation.\r\n\r\nC U S T O M I Z A T I O N : Like this design but want to change it a bit? Just ask! Have your own image or logo? Customize coasters any way you&#39;d like with **personalized coasters** www.etsy.com/listing/105809242\r\n\r\nP R O C E S S I N G / S H I P P I N G : Already made and ready to ship! I ship USPS Priority Mail. Transit times are 2-3 days for domestic and 6-10 days for international.\r\n\r\nTake a look at my other slate coaster designs\r\nwww.etsy.com/shop/ScatteredTreasures?section_id=11748560\r\n\r\nBack to my shop #scatteredtreasures\r\nhttps://www.scatteredtreasures.etsy.com",

I produce handmade stoneware in my studio in South Carolina.  All of my work is dishwasher, microwave and oven safe and is glazed in food-safe, lead free finishes. Because of the hand-made nature of my work, please expect slight variations in color, texture and size.\r\n\r\nCurrent Turnaround\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nCustom orders can take up to 8 weeks for completion (usually sooner, sometimes more during busy season).\r\n\r\nIf you would like to have your custom order shipped directly to the recipient with a note from you included in the box, please let me a know during the checkout process.  I would be happy to do that for you.\r\n\r\nI can ship the finished pieces to either you or the recipient upon completion. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT MY PIECES / TURNAROUND\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nI create each item from scratch when you order it, and I am the only artist in my studio. My turnaround time varies, based on my current volume of orders. I try to update this as frequently as possible:\r\n\r\nMy personalized pieces can not be made in advance. They are all created and customized especially for you. Pottery is a long process involving drying time, assembly, and multiple firings. My turnaround is typically around 8 weeks, but can stretch out for 3 to 4 months during the busiest times. I can only make so many orders at a time, and I book up quickly. \r\n\r\nPlease note that pottery can also be unpredictable, as my items are fired to over 2000 degrees. While it is rare, there are occasions where a piece doesn&#39;t make it, and has to be redone. (Mostly it&#39;s because I&#39;m a perfectionist) I try to plan enough time for an occasional mishap, but please plan ahead and leave plenty of time when ordering.",
"policy_payment": "Before I will begin working on your piece(s), payment must be processed via Paypal or by Direct Checkout using a debit or credit card . If you have completed this step, Paypal or Etsy will notify you with an email receipt.

In the US, most packages will ship USPS Priority Mail; expect in most cases to receive your package within 2-5 days. Occasionally items will ship USPS Parcel Post or UPS which may take up to a week to arrive. International and APO/FPO addresses and holiday shipping should expect longer shipping times, sometimes as much as 30 days. We include tracking on most of our packages.\r\n\r\nWe do our best to estimate shipping costs and to combine shipping when possible. Multiple piece orders often ship in separate boxes to prevent breakage. \r\n\r\nPlease note that shipping costs include actual postage paid plus the cost of the packing materials used to ship your order safely. We encourage you to recycle and reuse once you get your pottery!\r\n\r\nInternational shipping is available! Please contact us with the details so we can calculate accurate shipping costs. Customs forms will be filled out for merchandise for the exact purchase price with no exceptions. Note that buyers are responsible for any and all duties, taxes and customs charges that may be incurred. \r\n\r\nItems can be sent to a gift address, or multiple gift addresses- just send us the information. Let us know when you order and we&#39;ll include a card too! \r\n\r\nSorry, we do not gift wrap.\r\n\r\nDamaged items: I spend a lot of time packaging items to ensure they&#39;ll arrive in one piece. If for some reason you receive a damaged item in your box, please keep the piece including packaging so I can make a USPS insurance claim. I will replace the item free of charge including shipping costs.\r\n\r\n\r\nEverywhere Else\r\nWe do not offer refunds on lost or damaged items on internationally shipped items.  I do take extra precautions when packing.\r\n\r\n SHIPPING DELAYS ‚Äì While most of my packages include insurance, tracking, and delivery confirmation, both USPS Priority Mail and First Class International are non-guaranteed delivery methods offered by USPS. Please visit USPS.com to understand guaranteed delivery options. We cannot accept responsibility for any transport delays outside our shop‚Äôs control. If we are introducing the delay, we will contact the buyer and workout arrangements to get back on track to a needed delivery date.\r\n\r\nInternational shipping times can range anywhere from 6 days to 6 weeks depending on the country and customs. We are not responsible for customs taxes or fees. Customs rules and fees are different in every country, check with your country&#39;s customs laws if you have questions about this. \r\n\r\nPlease note that the USPS provides a great service at great prices but sometimes delays in shipping and even loss can occur. This does not happen often but it can. Once an item leaves our shop it is completely out of our hands. We hope that if this ever happens to you that you&#39;d be understanding and contact us immediately so we can rectify the situation. Our customers happiness with our products and service is our number one priority. If you happen to experience this we will ALWAYS find a way to get you your product!\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING WEIGHT LIMITS ‚Äì If a combined order exceeds the single package limit of 4 pounds for First Class International will be communicate the additional funds required to upgrade the shipping and complete the order.",
"policy_refunds": "I take great care in packing my pottery so it arrives safely at your door. Occasionally, damage occurs in shipping. If you have any problem with your shipment when it arrives, please contact me for replacement or refund.\r\n\r\nI want you to be happy with your new pottery. Please contact me with any concerns, questions or problems with your order. I work hard to have happy repeat customers! I will gladly replace your broken, damaged or flawed pottery; I&#39;ll cover the shipping and get your replacement to you ASAP.\r\n\r\nI do accept exchanges and returns on regular purchases; however the buyer is responsible for the shipping costs to return the item(s). If it is an exchange, the buyer must also pay to re-ship the new item(s). I am not responsible for damage that occurs to item(s) packed by buyers.\r\n\r\nI do not accept returns/exchanges on custom orders.",
"policy_additional": "IS YOUR POTTERY FOOD SAFE? CAN I PUT IT IN MY MICROWAVE? WHAT ABOUT MY DISHWASHER?\r\n\r\nAll of my pottery that is made for functional kitchen use is lead-free and food safe. You can put it in the dishwasher, microwave, freezer...even your oven! Just avoid sudden temperature changes, like taking a bowl out of the fridge and putting it in a 350* oven or putting a hot dish into a sink of cold water.\r\n\r\nCAN I GET A DISCOUNT IF I BUY MORE THAN ONE PIECE?\r\n\r\nI am always pleased when customers are anxious to buy more than one piece of my work! However, I do not offer discounts for regular retail purchases. If you&#39;re interested in a wholesale order of $500 or more, please contact me with the details.\r\n\r\nI BOUGHT A BUNCH OF STUFF FROM YOUR SITE HOPING TO GET A MATCHED SET BUT ALL THE PIECES LOOK A LITTLE DIFFERENT!\r\n\r\nEverything I make is handmade piece by piece. Due to the nature of handmade goods slight variations do occur. Each glaze batch and each kiln firing create slightly different color results as well. If you are interested in a set of something, please custom order it and it will all be thrown, glazed and fired together -assuring a better match.\r\n\r\nI REALLY LIKE THAT MUG, BUT CAN I GET IT IN A DIFFERENT COLOR?\r\n\r\nYes you can, but you may have to wait a while if I don&#39;t have what you want in stock right now. I am firing kilns all the time, but it takes several weeks to go from lump of clay to pretty finished mug. \r\n\r\nWHAT IS YOUR CUSTOM ORDER POLICY? DO I HAVE TO PAY UP FRONT FOR CUSTOM WORK?\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s how custom orders work in my shop:\r\nWe can discuss (via conversations here on Etsy) the specifics of your order, including the estimated delivery time. Using this information, I will create a custom listing in the shop just for you. Once you purchase the listing, I will get to work crafting your order. Once it&#39;s complete, I&#39;ll ship it out to you! If you &quot;Like&quot; RiverStone Pottery on Facebook, might even see pictures of your pieces being made!\r\n\r\nTurn around time for custom work depends on the item(s) I am making and where I am in my production cycle. In general, your can expect to wait roughly 4-8 weeks for most custom orders. \r\n\r\nAll custom work must be paid 100% up front before work starts, including shipping costs. \r\n\r\nI do not offer returns/exchanges/refunds on custom orders, except in the case of goods damaged in shipping.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

They vary in size and shape, with the largest bead just under an inch long.\r\n\r\nAfrican cappuccino jasper is a reddish brown stone with creamy whites and pale grays and highlights of peach and coral. Goldstone is a glittering glass that accents the warm tones in the cappuccino jasper and adds a bit of texture to the necklace.\r\n\r\nThe strand of beads is just under 18 inches, with each end attached to an etched brass ring and brass chain to complete this long necklace. The necklace is secured with a lobster claw clasp and is adjustable from 29 to 31 inches.\r\n\r\nI used Vintaj natural brass chain, wire and findings to make this necklace. Vintaj is 100% natural brass. Its unique and artistic character is achieved through an eco-friendly process, which is nickel-free and lead-free.\r\n\r\n‚ô•  Click on this link to view the shorter version of this necklace:  https://www.etsy.com/listing/220034053/cappuccino-jasper-beaded-necklace-jasper\r\n\r\n‚ô•  Want to purchase this item?
