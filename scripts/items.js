"policy_payment": "Since almost every piece of furniture is custom to order full payment is required before fabrication begins. There are no refunds.  I will work with you if thereis a manufacture defect. (failed joint, broken leg ect.) No refund also means that there is no cancellations on custom orders.  I am a small business and don&#39;t have the capitol to be giving refunds or returning money because you&#39;ve decided you don&#39;t want the table anymore.  That being said every one of my pieces is crafted to the highest quality. You will not be disappointed. \r\n\r\nHappy shopping!",
"policy_shipping": "For items under 5 feet we ship out in a custom made crate via FedEx, dismantling of the crate may require a drill or a strong hand and a screwdriver. (We recommend a drill). We try and give you the best customer service possible but we cannot be responsible for coordinating the delivery of the pieces after the first attempt. Please contact FedEx directly to schedule any second attempt at delivery. \r\n\r\nFor Items OVER 5 feet, we ship out using a white glove service. This is a meticulous   furniture moving service that blanket wraps the pieces and brings them right to your door. Pieces this large take MORE TIME to build and ship; approximately a month to deliver. Keep in mind that the Jeremiah Collection is NOT responsible for any damages made during shipping.  \r\n\r\nINFORMATION FOR SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA ORDERS: \r\n-If you would like to PICK UP your piece use our coupon &quot;FREEPICKUP&quot; with purchase and contact us via Etsy to schedule the time.

"description": "PRICE IS FOR EACH LEG! Update the quantity to suit your project&#39;s needs.\r\n\r\nView all sizes and shapes under &quot;Shop Sections&quot; at http://www.etsy.com/shop/ModernLegs\r\n\r\nHairpin table legs are the perfect way to turn a piece of reclaimed wood into a beautiful piece of furniture. These legs are made with 1/2&quot; square steel bar. Standard sizes are 4&quot; - 30&quot; tall, but I have made them as tall as 48&quot;. Great for anything from a coffee table to a kitchen table or even a modern looking office desk, these legs get their inspiration from Eames Era furniture design. \r\n\r\nThe L bracket is 5&quot; x 5&quot; and if it doesn&#39;t fit your project I can make any shape and design of bracket to accommodate. The mounting holes will accommodate up to 1/4&quot; hardware (not included).\r\n\r\nEvery piece is hand made to order by me. I am proud to say that my legs are 100% made in the USA from environmentally friendly, recyclable raw steel that is from a local steel mill, not China!  \r\n\r\nThe legs will ship with a slight amount of oily residue to keep them from rusting during transit. This is easily removed with a rag and a general household cleaner (NON ACIDIC / NON CITRUS). I recommend adding a clear coat or wax finish after cleaning to preserve their appearance.\r\n\r\nThere is a reason why my shop has more sales of hairpin legs than any other shop on Etsy, it is because I have over 17 years of welding experience and I provide a superior product! \r\n\r\nAsk about wholesale pricing for large orders.\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION TIME IS TWO WEEKS. \r\n\r\nPRICE IS FOR EACH LEG! Update the quantity to suit your project&#39;s needs.\r\n\r\nAll sales are final on custom orders. Standard sizes may be returned with buyer responsible for shipping. 10% restocking fee on all returned items.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!",

He also knew the work involved in the life of the dancer, the endless repetition of steps to achieve grace, agility, and expression. He pursued the subject for over 40 years through oils, pastels, drawings, prints, and sculpture, creating over 1,500 works devoted to the anatomy, posture, and movement of dancers. Degas’s Dancers at the Barre: Point and Counterpoint is the first exhibition of Degas’s dancers in Washington, D.C., in 25 years.\n\nThe impressionist master’s relentless experiments with movement and dance culminated in Dancers at the Barre (early 1880s–c. 1900).",

"announcement": "Buy 2 and get 1 free. Sheet music giclee artwork is available in the following sizes: 4x6, 5x7, and 8.5x11.

Does not include Mason Jars.\r\n\r\nThanks so much for browsing my shop. Please let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n*** Frames not included. ***\r\n\r\nAbout Polaroids:\r\nEach Polaroid Picture is a finely crafted work of art that you can hold in your hands. These Polaroid Pictures make great conversation pieces and enhance any room they are in. No two are the same, each one being unique creation. \r\n\r\nClassic works of art re-imagined on real Polaroid Photographs. From Alice in Wonderland to Degas, Picasso, Van Gogh, Cezanne, Klimt, Monet, and more. I can even turn your Instagram pictures into Polaroids. Perfect for your living room, library, or as wall art. Need a gift? Surprise a friend with this truly unique and original work of art. \r\n\r\nFollow me on Instagram:\r\n@polaroidartwork\r\nhttp://sheetmusicartprints.tumblr.com/\r\n\r\nPolaroid Format:\r\nFormat: 3.5 x 4.2 in (8.8 x 10.7 cm)\r\nImage area: 3.1 x 3.1 in (7.9 x 7.9 cm)\r\nFinish: Glossy\r\n\r\nSheet Music Format\r\nSizes:\r\n4x6\r\n5x7\r\n8.5x11 (formatted to fit an 8x10 frame)\r\n\r\nIf you are new to Etsy, this great tutorial makes purchasing easy: https://www.etsy.com/help/article/339\r\n\r\nAbout Analog Photography:\r\nUnlike with digital photography, analog instant photography is somewhat unpredictable, yet beautiful. Key to this is a chemical process that happens inside of the photo: after taking a picture, the film is pulled through camera rollers which break open a pod containing a reagent that is spread between the exposed negative and receiving positive sheet. Unlike roll film, integral film integrates all the layers to expose, develop, and fix the photo into a plastic envelope. There are no pixels, no digital data, but chemical components that react when exposed to light. This makes every picture literally unique. \r\n\r\nIf you have any questions please let me know. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nTom",

"description": "Hand painted mug with tie and &quot;awesome&quot; tie bar.\r\n\r\nFull disclosure- my dad pretty much only wears ties at weddings and funerals.  Okay, that&#39;s my stepdad.  But really, he&#39;s my dad.  My actual dad wore ties every day to work.  And he was a jerk. So does wearing a tie everyday make you a jerk?  I&#39;m not sure.  I&#39;d say there&#39;s no clear evidence (other than my father) and probably some university should study this.  \r\n\r\nHowever, if my stepdad were to wear ties all the time, he&#39;d definitely deserve an &quot;awesome&quot; tie bar.  I&#39;d get him one of those.  Cause duh, he&#39;s awesome.  If my actual dad were to wear a tie bar I&#39;d have to get a custom one to say &quot;douche&quot;. \r\n\r\nIf you would like this item customized in any way, I&#39;d be happy to do so. Want a special phrase? Please just send me a message so I can create your own unique design! If I don&#39;t get back to you right away, be patient.  I&#39;m probably shopping for ugly vintage ties.\r\n\r\nMug is microwave and dishwasher safe.  Ink is heat-set but please do not use abrasives on the drawn surface.\r\n\r\nNote, mug will be made to order so may vary slightly from photo.\r\n\r\n***Also, shipping cost is due to mug weight.  These are the old fashioned, heavy duty diner mugs.  They hold about 8 oz but weigh over a pound each!  If you get tired of drinking coffee you can use this as a light gym weight. :)***\r\n\r\nPlease visit the rest of my shop to see more freaking awesome stuff:\r\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪\r\nhttp://knotworkshop.etsy.com\r\n✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪",

Most single item orders will ship via First Class. Anything over 13 ounces will ship via Priority Mail or Parcel Post, larger packages ship preferably flat rate. Typically, up to 6 jars can ship in a small box tucked inside a flat rate envelope. Anything more will ship medium flat rate or Regional A due to the weight of the jars.\r\n\r\nPlease note shipping times (per usps.com):\r\n\r\nThis does not include shop processing time.\r\n\r\nFirst Class Mail~Estimated delivery time is two to three days.\r\n\r\nParcel Post~Typically 2 - 9 days in the 48 contiguous states for most origins / destinations. Specific time standards may be available when postage is calculated.\r\n\r\nPriority Mail~Typically two to three days to most locations in the US (Specific delivery standards may be available when postage is calculated). This is not a guaranteed service.\r\n\r\nIf your order is returned for any reason (ie; wrong mailing address provided by you), you are responsible for shipping charges to resend the package. Please make sure your shipping address in your Etsy account is up to date. I am not responsible for lost packages due to wrong address info submitted by the cutsomer. If a shipping error was made on my part, you are not responsible for additional shipping charges.\r\n\r\nDuring hot weather some products may appear liquidy, this is normal, just place in a cool place and the product will re-solidify. This does not affect the quality of the product. Whipped soaps, Bathory, Lotion and sugar scrubs may not ship during hot weather.\r\n\r\nAll orders ship with delivery confirmation. Insurance is included with orders up to $50.\r\n",

All whipped soaps and bubbling scrubs are packaged by weight and not by volume. \r\n\r\nLIP BALMS: The propel-repel mechanism in our tubes was made for a twist up use only, these are not like lipstick tubes that can be twisted up and then back down. Only twist out what is needed at time of use. Failing to do so can result in product being wasted and not being able to be twisted back into the tube. This is just the nature of the packaging and does not constitute a defective product and is not subject to replacement, refund or exchange. \r\n\r\nLOTIONS: Please store in a cool place and out of direct light. If you live in a hot climate or during summer months lotion may arrive slightly liquid, place into the fridge for about 15 to 30 minutes and the lotion should go back to normal.\r\n\r\nLotion that contains vanilla notes or notes such as pumpkin, cake, etc may discolor over time to a tan, brown or even a pink color, this is completely normal.\r\n\r\nPlease do not use on the face.\r\n\r\nIf any irritation occurs, please discontinue use.\r\n\r\nBest when used within 6 months from date of purchase.\r\n\r\nVariations in size, color, scent and form are expected in each and every product and does not constitute a substantial flaw in the product. Furthermore, should you be displeased with a scent, it is up to you, the buyer, to purchase samples that are offered ahead of time to find which scent is right for you. Scents are a personal choice and what may be great for one may not be for another. We do not send a replacement nor refund for items based off of these reasons.\r\n\r\nAll sales are final. No exceptions.",

If irritation occurs, please discontinue use and contact your physician.\r\n\r\nVariations in size, color, scent and form are expected in each and every product and does not constitute a substantial flaw in the product.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere will be times where ones body chemistry just does not want to tolerate them, whether it&#39;d be morphing or the scent just doesn&#39;t last. Unfortunately this happens from time to time and is unpreventable.\r\n\r\nEach scent is described with each note that is used for that scent. I try to be descriptive as possible. There are times when one nose may smell something entirely different from another&#39;s. I find it interesting when a customer will tell me that a scent will smell like cantaloupe when there isn&#39;t a drop of that note in there. It just goes to show how different we are.\r\n\r\n*********************Dropship & Wholesale inquiries*******************************\r\n\r\nAt this time I do not dropship nor offer my products for wholesale.

I fell in love with creation in my childhood, sewing aprons for my Barbies & little stuffed bunnies alongside my mother & grandmothers as they quilted.  Now as a mother of four raising my family in the middle of the Midwest I make my creativity a part time career. \n       While my items are smoke & pet free, & I absolutely promise professionalism; I make no guarantees that the little hands of my 5 year old twins have not helped paint a few strokes on your sign or helped sew a bib button.  I sell in several venues, etsy being my newest, so I do spend a fair amount of time in my workshop.  I try to let my children be involved when appropriate, hopefully inspiring the next generation of craftswomen. \n        My shop motto reflects my belief that our creator is present in all the beautiful things surrounding us each day.  It thrills me to create works of scripture, hope, love & encouragement which will fill the homes of shoppers around the world, and gifts to be given in love.\n     I look forward to creating something wonderful for you!\n",

Circa 1930s\n\nCool graphic designs in black and gold with zigzags, dots and Turkish coffee pots. This is the glass for an exotic drink in a foreign port.\n\nFederal Glass Company started out making tumblers and by 1906 were also making bottles and jars.  By 1914 they were in full production of a wide variety of pressed glass and imitation cut glass patterns.  The company closed in 1980. \n\nAll four glasses are in excellent condition.  On two of them them the black pattern is slightly lighter.  Hand washing is recommended, the lighter pattern on those two may be the result of a trip through a dishwasher.\n\nMakers Mark:\nEach base has the imprint of an &quot;F within a shield&quot;, the mark for Federal Glass Company\n\nDimensions:\n4 7/8&quot; high\n\nDomestic Shipping includes delivery confirmation & insurance.\nInternational Shipping is available, please convo for cost.\n\n~••~•~•~••~•~•~••~•~•~••~•~•~••~•~•~••~•~•~••~•~•~••~•~•~••~\nback to shop, to see more vintage!\nTheVintaquarian.etsy.com\n~••~•~•~••~•~•~••~•~•~••~•~•~••~•~•~••~•~•~••~•~•~••~•~•~••~",
